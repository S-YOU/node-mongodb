Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning!  Warning! Warning!

This package is EXPERIMENTAL, with emphasis on MENTAL. I am working on this in
my spare time to learn the node.js, v8 and mongo API's. I am mixing C and C++.
I am probably doing it totally wrong. It will probably leak memory like sieve.
In fact, why are you reading this, run away before it's too late!

Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning!  Warning! Warning!

If that warning didn't scare you off then to build this package simply:

- Make sure you have git installed.
- ./update-mongo-c-driver.sh
- node-waf configure build
- node test_bson.js

Patches, beer, flames, adoration welcome!
